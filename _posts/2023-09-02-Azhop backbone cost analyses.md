In the rapidly evolving landscape of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the quest for optimizing operational cost without compromising performance has become paramount. Microsoft Azure's HPC On-Demand Platform (AzHOP) serves as an innovative solution that addresses both scale and flexibility needs. However, one area that often warrants scrutiny is the daily cost associated with the backbone infrastructure of AzHOP, which includes critical components such as Management VMs, persistent storage volumes, and more.

We will compare the daily backbone costs associated with different AzHOP configurations. Specifically, we will look at setups with SLURM DB and Azure Active Directory (AAD) enabled. We will explore three different storage options: 4TB Azure Files, 4TB Premium Azure NetApp Files, and Azure Managed Lustre File System (AMLFS), to examine how each impacts the overall cost and performance.

The objective is to arm decision-makers and technical experts with concrete insights that can guide them in selecting the most cost-effective yet performant backbone infrastructure for their Azure HPC deployments.
